# Mass-Spectrometric-Imaging
The sample stage control and data acquisition software was developed in-house. Two-dimensional images were acquired by moving the stage in steps of 250 μm in x and 100 μm in the y-direction. The z-axis of the image represents the bradykinin signal intensity in a single shot mass spectrum. In total, 441 shots were distributed over an area of roughly 5 mm x 3 mm, and consecutive runs were recorded by an intermediate 30 μm shift in the x-direction, interlacing the different runs of 441 shots for better comparability and minimizing the influence of sample inhomogeneity.
